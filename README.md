# xkcd_downloader
usage: ./xkcd_down_multi.py
Download all xkcd comics(since the beginning of time) from www.xkcd.com. Downloading done by multhreading in Python.
Download starts from the latest comic to the oldest one.
No limit on number of threads used. Will try to use maximum bandwidth. Images having problems to download is shown in the
end when all others have finished donloading.
Future work: modify this repo and make it automatic comic downloader, new ones will be automatically downloaded.
